# Introduction

A simple NextJS-app with a search-bar.

## Todo

- Filter by board game, not by name
- Add a function to automatically alphabetize board game lists
- Add a button to clear searchTerm whenever searchTerm.length > 0
- If a game in a persons wishlist is owned by another person, add a green pip in the wishlist (next to the game title)
